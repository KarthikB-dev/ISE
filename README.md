ISE, or integrated studying environment, is a collection of software that
you can use for studying. This includes a notetaking application, 
study timer, and a todo list.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## How to use

1. Navigate to the correct folder 
2. Enter ```javac Main.java``` then ```java Main.java```
- for the study timer, substitute Main.java with Timer.java
3. Have fun using the best piece of software ever created!
