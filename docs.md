# Encryption

Encryption is _not_ supported on Microsoft Windows. Here are the instructions for how
to encrypt your notes or tasks using OS X and GNU/Linux;

## installing dendencies
1. GNU/Linux:


GPG is included by default on most GNU/Linux distributions, and so you have nothing to install.


2. OS X:


```brew install gnupg```

## performing file encryption
Navigate to the 'Encryption' folder. Run either ```Encryption.java``` or
```Decryption.java``` depending on which one you want to do. Keep in mind that the 
program waits 30 seconds before removing the encrypted or decrypted version of the 
text file.
