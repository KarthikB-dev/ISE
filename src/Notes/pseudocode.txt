User input:

nn (new note)
- Program checks if the map is empty. Since the map is empty at this point, 
it does not ask the user for what note this note should be added to
cout what is the section name?
cin <Computers>
cout what are the contents? enter ~ if there are none
cin <something that automates arithmetic>

1: Computers
    *= something that automates arithmetic

treeMap

1: <the computer note>

nn 
- program sees that the treeMap is not empty, and asks the user for what
note the new note should be added to
- however, the program sees that there is only one note, and so the program knows that
the user can only really add the new note to that one existing note

cout what is the section name?
cin <networking>
cout what are the contents? enter ~ if there are none
cin <protocols and infrastructure for data communication between computers>

When printing out the note structure, be sure to increment some number whose scope is larger than the method
itself
1: Computers
    *= something that automates arithmetic
    2: Networking
    *= protocols and infrastructure for data communication between computers

treeMap
1: <the computer note>
2: <the networking note>

nn 
- the program sees that there is more than one note in the map, and then it asks the user which note the new note should be added to

cout which note should the new note be added to?

cin <2>

cout What is the name of the new note?

cin <Network security>
cout what are the contents? enter ~ if there are none
cin <Preserving CIA within a computer network>
